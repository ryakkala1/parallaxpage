			<p>The Nike Air Force One (AF-1) has become an icon of fashion, style, and comfort. People from every age-group adore these trainers for having distinctive shapes and versatile designs. We take a look at the history of the AF-1 and some of its most eponymous models.On its 1982 introduction to the court, Nike designer Bruce Kilgore’s creation, initially only available as a high top, was striking for its hiking-boot-inspired cues and uniquely chunky sole—it was the first Nike Air cushioning on a hoops shoe. The neutral white and grey palette was one of the only parts of the shoe that played it safe. Inevitably, bolder, team-color Forces would follow—as would a low-cut, making the Air Force 1 an even more popular choice.</p>

		<p>Nike’s initial intent was to shelve the AF1 in favor of the next style, the next technology. But the model lengthened its lifeline thanks to an extended collection of different colors, a byproduct of a “color of the month” initiative pushed by a cartel of Baltimore retailers (Charley Rudo, Downtown Locker Room, and Cinderella Shoes) making ambitious orders for special makeups. Those exclusives turned the city into a destination for Forces; footwear tourism along Interstate 95 brought the sneaker’s cult status to D.C. and New York.</p>

	<div class="parallax3">
		<p>Phased out shortly afterwards, the AF1 returned around 1986 to select East Coast stores (with a slightly altered shape complete with more regional exclusives).Due to the increasing demand for the trainers, the retailers started releasing limited editions, which again was a huge success. Nike AF-1 got countrywide recognition.</p>

		<p>The sneaker has a history of very little marketing, outside of the original ads that featured the likes of NBA stars Moses Malone and Mychal Thompson, but it was sold by Nike strictly in inner city markets. The subsequent gentrification of urban sneaker culture gives the impression that the AF1 is a people's shoe that transcends race, gender, and class. But without its initial inner city fan base keeping it alive, the Force would most likely be little more than a shoe praised by true connoisseurs and historians but forgotten by everyone else.The Air Force 1's still use little to no marketing as its legacy has been cemented in history.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		<p>For special events and occasions, Nike introduces Sneaker Gold. The exclusive, limited premium edition sells before reaching then retailers.The AF1 mid hits in the mid-90s (so too did the jewel Swoosh, seen here); in 2001, a slew of new colorways flood the international market. With the 2000’s came High-tech uppers — made with proprietary materials such as Foamposite, Hyperfuse, Liquid Metal and Flyknit — hit the market. In early 2000 the creation of the nikeiD led to a tremendous amount of variations as users now had the opportunity to personalize the shoes to their liking.</p>

		<p>Nike introduces women’s sizing to the AF1. The shape and details of these types of releases also look the same to the naked eye. There are small differences in the dimensions. For Nike, a Womans release is 0.5 centimeters larger on paper. The heel of these women’s sneakers is sometimes slightly narrower. Although these differences are hardly noticeable, Womans releases are slightly larger.Usually the women’s colorways are very good. Lovely soft colors such as pink and mint, but also great variations on OG releases.</p>

		<p>In 2014 the shape of the airforce was reenvisioned by many designers. In 1982, the cross-pollination of running technology into basketball design forever changed the trajectory of basketball footwear. Nike Air, although invisible, made its court debut in the sole of the Air Force 1. Three decades later, Nike Sportswear reintroduces and re-envisions the iconic basketball shoe for the women who have adopted this style as their own. Realizing that personal style varies from person to person, the Nike Sportswear design team created a spectrum of Air Force silhouettes that stay true to the heritage of the Air Force 1 while offering significant updates in fit and form. The original Air Force 1 Low and High are joined by the all new Air Force 1 Ultra, Ultra Mid and Nike Lunar Force 1 Sky Hi to bring the legendary silhouette to places no force has gone before.

		<p>In 2018 the pastel version of the Air Force 1 referred to as Pale ivory and Shadow shoes were created.&nbsp;This mysterious edition of the Air Force 1 disguises its colorful inner workings beneath a thin shell of white textile. A subtle text graphic on the toe box invites the wearer to "Tear Here" — and upon following that prompt and removing the shoe's protective film, a spectrum of shades and textures are brought to light.</p>

		<p>In 2020 a color-changing Air Force 1 that is UV reactive was released. The model designed by Bruce Kilgore is re-proposed in 2 apparently very similar versions but with a very different surprise effect: they have in common the white leather panels, a monochromatic midsole combined with a semi-transparent ice blue sole. The most anticipated Air Force 1 of the season is the UV Reactive that completely changes its look when exposed to UV rays:: the upper characterized by a particular photosensitive coating allows the shoe to go from a completely white canvas to a multicolor invasion. The end result is an explosion of colors such as blue, yellow, fuchsia and lilac that emerge only in the open air and that "turn off" when worn indoors.

		<p>The Louis Vuitton x Nike Air Force 1 sneakers redefined the fashion industry's definition of "iconic" when first seen in the summer of 2021 and again at Virgil Abloh's final LV runway show. Hyperbole? Hardly: the shoes combine three cultural titans (Louis Vuitton, Virgil Abloh, Nike) into a plethora of special colorways both brash and quietly luxe. There's co-branded text done up in Abloh's signature style, quotation marks, monogrammed canvas, succulent leather uppers, references to bootleg culture — everything anyone needs for a killer collab. On January 19, LV and Sotheby's announced that the collaborative LV x Nike AF1 will debut through an auction on Sotheby's website beginning January 26 with bids beginning at $2,000 — expect them to go for much more by auction's end, which was originally February 8 and got pushed to February 9 ("closure times are subject to change," Sotheby's said). 1 / 7</p>
